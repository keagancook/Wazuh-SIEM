# AGENT CONFIGURATION
Setting up an agent is very easy with Wazuh

First, open `Endpoints` on the Wazuh Dashboard. Then, select `Deploy New Agent`

Select the correct information for the particular agent you are attempting to integrate, enter the Wazuh Server IP address, and run the commands it outputs on your agent device. DONE!

*****note*
On this particular system, 3 agents were configured. The first is running on a Windows 11 personal desktop computer, next an Ubuntu File Server running Nextcloud, and finally a Raspberry Pi board running Pi-Hole DNS.
